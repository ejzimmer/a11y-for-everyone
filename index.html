					A11y begins with design

					Knowledge sharing

					how to upskill yourself (and other interested people)
					certifications

					PR comments & design annotations

					Slack channel where people can ask questions and more knowledgable people can answer them
					We've got an AI agent to help with this. Speeds up writing answers, but definitely requires monitoring & checking by experts
